        <h2>For years, Americans have been told that brushing twice a day and flossing are the foundation of good oral
            health.</h2>

        <p>Yet millions still struggle with bleeding gums, bad breath that won’t go away, tooth sensitivity, and
            recurring cavities.</p>

        <p>According to Dr. Michael Harrington, DDS, a U.S.-based dentist with over two decades of clinical experience,
            the reason is simple:</p>

        <blockquote>
            “Brushing and flossing are important — but they are no longer enough.”
            <cite>— Dr. Michael Harrington, DDS</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Big Oral Health Mistake Most People Make Every Day</h2>

        <p>Dr. Harrington explains that most oral care routines focus on eliminating bacteria, not understanding them.
        </p>

        <p>Toothpaste, alcohol-based mouthwashes, and whitening products are designed to kill bacteria indiscriminately.
        </p>

        <p>“The problem is that your mouth needs good bacteria to stay healthy.”</p>

        <p>This daily habit creates an imbalance known as oral microbiome disruption — now linked to gum disease, decay,
            and chronic halitosis.</p>

        <p class="img-caption">An imbalance in oral bacteria can lead to chronic issues despite regular brushing.</p>

        <!-- H2 – Causa raiz -->
        <h2>The Real Cause of Gum Disease and Persistent Bad Breath</h2>

        <p>The human mouth contains billions of bacteria, both good and bad.</p>

        <p>When harmful bacteria dominate, common symptoms appear:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Inflamed or bleeding gums</li>
            <li>Chronic bad breath</li>
            <li>Weak enamel</li>
            <li>Increased cavity risk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>“Brushing harder doesn’t fix this,” says Dr. Harrington. “It often makes it worse.”</p>

        <!-- H2 – Autoridade + prova -->
        <h2>Why Traditional Dentistry Doesn’t Fix the Root Cause</h2>

        <p>Modern dentistry treats symptoms, not bacterial balance.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cavities are filled</li>
            <li>Gums are scraped</li>
            <li>Breath is masked</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But none of these address the underlying microbiome imbalance.</p>

        <p>“You can’t solve a biological problem with chemicals alone,” Dr. Harrington explains.</p>

        <!-- H2 – Solução -->
        <h2>The Oral Health Breakthrough Dentists Are Finally Talking About</h2>

        <p>New research highlights the importance of supporting beneficial oral bacteria, not destroying them.</p>

        <p>This approach uses oral probiotics to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Restore bacterial balance</li>
            <li>Support gum health</li>
            <li>Improve breath naturally</li>
            <li>Strengthen teeth defenses</li>
        </ul>

        <p>“When patients fix the microbiome, results improve dramatically,” says Dr. Harrington.</p>

        <!-- H2 – Urgência etária -->
        <h2>Why Oral Health Gets Worse After 30</h2>

        <p>Age, stress, medications, and dry mouth reduce beneficial bacteria.</p>

        <p>This explains why adults suddenly experience:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Gum recession</li>
            <li>Bad breath</li>
            <li>Tooth sensitivity</li>
        </ul>

        <p>“This isn’t about hygiene,” warns Dr. Harrington. “It’s about biology.”</p>

        <!-- H2 – Conclusão + autoridade -->
        <h2>A Dentist’s Final Warning</h2>

        <p>“If you rely only on brushing and flossing, you’re missing the most important part of oral health.”</p>

        <p>Ignoring bacterial balance can lead to irreversible damage over time.</p>
