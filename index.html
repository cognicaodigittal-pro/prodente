        <h2>For years, Americans have been told that brushing twice a day and flossing are the foundation of good oral
            health.</h2>

        <p>Yet millions still struggle with bleeding gums, bad breath that won’t go away, tooth sensitivity, and
            recurring cavities.</p>

        <p>According to Dr. Michael Harrington, DDS, a U.S.-based dentist with over two decades of clinical experience,
            the reason is simple:</p>

        <blockquote>
            “Brushing and flossing are important — but they are no longer enough.”
            <cite>— Dr. Michael Harrington, DDS</cite>

        <h2>The Big Oral Health Mistake Most People Make Every Day</h2>

        <p>Most oral care routines focus on eliminating bacteria, not supporting balance.
        </p>
        <p>Toothpaste and mouthwashes are designed to kill bacteria indiscriminately.</p>
        <p>This disrupts the oral microbiome, which plays a critical role in gum health and breath.</p>

        <!-- H2 – Causa raiz -->
        <h2>The Real Cause of Gum Disease and Persistent Bad Breath</h2>

        <p>The human mouth contains billions of bacteria, both good and bad.</p>

        <p>When harmful bacteria dominate, common symptoms appear:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Inflamed or bleeding gums</li>
            <li>Chronic bad breath</li>
            <li>Weak enamel</li>
            <li>Increased cavity risk</li>
        </ul>

        <p>“Brushing harder doesn’t fix this,” says Dr. Harrington. “It often makes it worse.”</p>

        <h2>Why Traditional Dentistry Doesn’t Fix the Root Cause</h2>

        <p class="img-caption">Modern dentistry often treats symptoms without fixing the biological root cause.</p>

        <p>Dentistry often treats symptoms without restoring bacterial balance.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cavities are filled</li>
            <li>Gums are scraped</li>
            <li>Breath is masked</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But none of these address the underlying microbiome imbalance.</p>

        <p>“You can’t solve a biological problem with chemicals alone,” Dr. Harrington explains.</p>

        <h2>The Oral Health Breakthrough Dentists Are Finally Talking About</h2>

        <p>Supporting beneficial bacteria is now recognized as essential for oral health.</p>



        <p>“When patients fix the microbiome, results improve dramatically,” says Dr. Harrington.</p>

        <!-- H2 – Urgência etária -->
        <h2>Why Oral Health Gets Worse After 30</h2>

        <p>Age, stress, medications, and dry mouth reduce beneficial bacteria.</p>

        <p>This explains why adults suddenly experience:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Gum recession</li>
            <li>Bad breath</li>
            <li>Tooth sensitivity</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ignoring bacterial balance can lead to long-term oral health issues.</p>
